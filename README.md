**My Favorite movie is *The Lorax***

- "The Lorax" is well-known for its strong environmental message. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked industrialization, deforestation, and the importance of environmental conservation.
- The movie is based on the classic children's book "The Lorax" written by Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel). Dr. Seuss's original work, published in 1971, has been cherished for its imaginative storytelling and its impactful message about the need to protect the environment.
- The film boasts an impressive voice cast, including actors such as Zac Efron (Ted), Taylor Swift (Audrey), Danny DeVito (The Lorax), and Ed Helms (The Once-ler). The talented cast contributed to bringing the characters to life and enhancing the overall appeal of the animated feature.
